            <strong>About This Website</strong>
        </p>
      <p class="intro">
        This website is a side project by a computer science student who also has a passion for glowing skin. 
        I'm by no means a skincare expert but I've gained some knowledge along the way and through building this website.
        While there's many sites which give a customized skincare formulation based on your skin type, this website is for
        the people who want to avoid the extra cost of convenience and are okay with putting together their own routine
        by buying products separately in order to reach their specific skin goals.
